This is a HTTP server written in C using UNIX sockets.
The server supports GET, POST and HEAD requests.

When the server receives a request it checks the header for method and handles the request corresponding to that method.

GET: 
     The server constructs a HTML page in-memory and serves it to the client.

POST: 
     The server constructs a HTML page in-memory, extracts the data from the body of the requests and injects it into the html, page.

HEAD: 
     The server just sends the header.
